Since Dec 20 2015, I have spent two days on building this blog on my github account with Jekyll. Now, I've got a personal webpage hosted on github with a static blog page and a demonstration page for my projects in the field of Physics or CompSci.

The main reason why I built this blog is to record down my personal progress and continuous thoughts in Physics and CompSci, also as a tool to boost my current interests in both topics. Although the current interface looks plain, it doesn't affect its main usage, yet I'll try to update the interface later. That's it.

At last, to quote from one blog in Zhihu:

> Writing is a second way to learn.
