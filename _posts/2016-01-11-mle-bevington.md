- Author: Philip R. Bevington

### Notes:
1. Why Maximum Likelihood?
  Suitable for various distribution functions and multiparameter fits. MLM can be applied to many "curve fitting" problems. Also, the direct maximum-likelihood method requires computations for each measured event, rather than for each histogram bin as in least-square fitting, and the technique may be slow for very large data samples, but wouldn't have loss of information.
