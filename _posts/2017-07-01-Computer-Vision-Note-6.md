### Lesson 3A-L1 Cameras and Images
- Up till now, an image is a function, a 2D pattern of intensity values.
- From this lesson, we think of images as 2D projections of 3D points.
- Pinhole camera: we make an aperture on a barrier, so that the projection of object can form a complete graph on the film.
- Instead, we use a lens to make projection in real world. Thin lense theorem: 1/z1 + 1/z2 = 1/f (f = focus)
- Varying focus can change the depth of field to be shown on screen.
